This project features an interactive Excel dashboard, built using Power Query Editor, to analyze four years of financial data.
The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand key financial patterns and imbalances, enabling better decision-making.

Key insights covered include:

Sum of All Inflows & Outflows

Cumulative Outflows (2021–2024)

Cumulative Inflows (2021–2024)

Transactions Across Months

Spending Distribution by Category (e.g., Rent, Food, Health)

City-Specific Financial Trends (e.g., Chennai)

Payment Methods (Bank Transfer, Cash, etc.)

A deeper analysis of the data reveals:

Major financial imbalance: Expenses significantly exceed income.

Highest expense drivers: Rent and Food remain top contributors.

City impact: Chennai shows the highest spending due to urban living costs.

Payment behavior: Bank Transfers dominate, while Cash usage leads to inefficiencies and missed rewards.

Yearly & seasonal trends: Expenses increase each year, with seasonal spikes tied to travel and events.

Health spending: Critically low, indicating future financial risk.

Opportunities: Reduce essential expenses, diversify income, and conduct financial audits to manage discretionary spending.
